Feature Selection for Clustering
================================

|mit| |docs|

**FSFC** is a library with algorithms of feature selection for clustering.

It's based on the article `"Feature Selection for Clustering: A Review." <http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.295.8115>`_
by S. Alelyani, J. Tang and H. Liu

Algorithms are covered with tests that check their correctness and compute some clustering metrics.
For testing we use open datasets:

- Generic data - `High-dimensional points datasets <http://cs.uef.fi/sipu/datasets/>`_
- Text data - `SMS Spam Collection <https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/SMS+Spam+Collection>`_

Project documentation is available on `Read the Docs <http://fsfc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_

Implemented algorithms:
-----------------------

- Generic Data:
    - SPEC family - NormalizedCut, ArbitraryClustering, FixedClustering
    - Sparse clustering - Lasso
    - Localised feature selection - LFSBSS algorithm
    - Multi-Cluster Feature Selection
    - Weighted K-means
- Text Data:
    - Text clustering - Chi-R algorithm, Feature Set-Based Clustering (FTC)
    - Frequent itemset extraction - Apriori

Dependencies:
-------------

- numpy
- scikit-learn
- scipy

How to use:
-----------
Now the project is in the early alpha stage, so it isn't publish to pip.

Because of it, installation of the project is a bit complicated. To use **FSFC** you should:

1. Clone repository to your computer.
2. Run ``make init`` to install dependencies.
3. Copy content of the folder **fsfc** to the source root of your project.

After it you can use feature selectors as follows:

.. code:: python

    import numpy as np
    from fsfc.generic import NormalizedCut
    from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
    from sklearn.cluster import KMeans

    data = np.array([...])

    pipeline = Pipeline([
        ('select', NormalizedCut(3)),
        ('cluster', KMeans())
    ])
    pipeline.fit_predict(data)

How to support:
---------------
You can support development by testing and reporting of bugs or opening pull-requests.

Project has tests, they can be run with the command ``make test``

Also code there is a Sphinx documentation for code, it can be built with the command ``make html``.
Documentation uses ``numpydoc``, so it should be installed on the system. To do it, run ``pip install numpydoc``.
